# stroke-prediction-model-stacking

The aim of the project is to build a machine learning model that can predict if an individual is likely to get a stroke or has a high probability of getting a stroke, thus making it a classic classification problem. 
The approach however is quite different from an ordinary classification model.

We have utilized several baseline models and made a final dataset using the residuals (errors in prediction) from these baseline models. On this new dataset we have a trained a final model (meta model) to get a model with the most optimal predictive power. 

The 2 notebooks here have been coded in the form of a tutorial for anyone is willing to learn the following things:

1. Extensive EDA
2. Visualizations
3. Hypothesis Testing and its Applications
4. Model Stacking

Please feel free to download and play around with it.
